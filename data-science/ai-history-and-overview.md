# AI - History and Overview

## History of AI

![https://blogs.oracle.com/bigdata/difference-ai-machine-learning-deep-learning](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

## Definitions of AI

* Simulation of human processes by computer systems
  * Processes include:
    * learning&#x20;
    * remembering/ recall
    * reasoning
    * planning&#x20;
    * communicating
    * interacting with environment&#x20;
* Computer system's ability to correctly interpret and learn from external data, and to be able to adapt and use those learnings to achieve specific goals&#x20;

### AI and human cognition

* We can categorize human behavior into two buckets -- humans _**think**,_ and humans _**act**_.&#x20;
* Human thoughts and actions are not always rational, so we can categorize thoughts and actions into two buckets -- _**humanly**_ (human-like/ fallible), and _**rationally**_ (pure logic)&#x20;

#### Cognitive modeling

* Program "thinks" like the human.&#x20;
* Interdisciplinary field of cognitive science plus computer modeling&#x20;

#### Turing Test

A machine's ability to exhibit behavior, equivalent to, or indistinguishable from a human&#x20;

#### Laws of Thought

* Program that "thinks rationally (logically)"

#### Rational Agents

A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome.

### Narrow AI

[AI implementation](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/07/29/whats-difference-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-ai/) that is able to perform tasks as well as, or better than humans.&#x20;

**Examples**: image classification&#x20;

### Machine Learning

An algorithmic approach to parse data, learn from it, and make a determination or prediction about something. Machine learning models are trained using large data sets.&#x20;

#### Applications of ML

* tbd&#x20;

#### Algorithmic approaches in machine learning

* Decision tree learning&#x20;
* Inductive logic programming
* Clustering
* Reinforcement learning
* Bayesian networks

### Deep Learning
