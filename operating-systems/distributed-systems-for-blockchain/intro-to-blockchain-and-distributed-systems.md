# Intro to blockchain and distributed systems

## Notes

### Blockchain

* Generic name for technology of database and transaction processing that is transparent, secure and free.&#x20;
* Most familiar use case/ application of blockchain is cryptocurrency, but more specifically Bitcoin.&#x20;
* A blockchain is a record of transactions that is maintained by a network of clients. Each exchange of data is organized into "blocks", which get attached to the the "chain" of preceding blocks.
  * Two main sections of a block: block header and block body
* Peer-to-peer (P2P), decentralized and distributed networks is the backbone of blockchain&#x20;

#### Scalability of Blockchain

* Due to the distributed nature of blockchain, the problem of scalability comes to mind.&#x20;
* Throughput + information propagation time = block rate
* Also dependent upon the consensus algorithm and number of participants involved in the transaction.&#x20;
* Large number of participants will limit a desired high throughput&#x20;

#### Consensus mechanisms

* Protocols that make sure all nodes are synchronized and in agreement on the transactions.&#x20;

#### Popular consensus mechanisms

* Proof of work&#x20;
* Proof of stake&#x20;
* Delegated proof of stake&#x20;
* Proof of capacity

**Blockchain Historical context**

* Ideas around cryptocurrency have been around since at least 1990s
* Blockchain specifically came into vocabulary around 2008 when a paper was published online about Bitcoin &#x20;
