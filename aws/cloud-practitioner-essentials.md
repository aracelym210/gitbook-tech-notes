## Module 1 Objectives 
- Benefits of AWS
  - Flexibility of using resources as needed, and returning when no longer needed.
    - Makes it easier to develop and deploy applications  
  - Undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT (routine, repetive tasks) 
  - Trade upfront expense for variable expense 
    - Upfront expense = data centers, physical servers, etc. which requires payment before use
    - Variable expense = pay only for what you need
  - Focus less on managing infrastructure and servers and focus more on applications and customers 
  - Economies of scale allows AWS to provide lower pay-as-you-go prices
  - Applications can be deployed across the world quickly, providing customers around the world with low-latency 
- Differences between on-demand delivery and cloud deployments 
  - "On-demand delivery" indicates that resources are available as you need them, when you need them. Additionally, resources can be returned when not needed.
