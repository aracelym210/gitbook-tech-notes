# Google Cloud Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure

## Cloud Computing Definition

1. Customers get computing resources **on-demand** and via **self-service**
2. Resources are accessed over the network
3. Cloud provider has a big pool of resources and allocates to customers out of the pool
4. Resources are **elastic**, and therefore scalable
5. Pay as you go (or reserve)

## GCP Computing Architecure

* IaaS ---> Hybrid ---> PaaS (App Engine) ---> Serverless logic (Cloud functions) ---> Automated elastic resources (Managed services)&#x20;
* Google network is made of up hundreds of thousands kilometers of fiber cable, including subsea cables, more than 90 Internet exchanges and more than 100 Internet Points of Presence.&#x20;

#### Regions and Zones&#x20;

* Services can be zonal, regional, or managed by Google across regions&#x20;
* A zone is a deployment area for GCP resources within a region.&#x20;
  * Single failure domain within a region&#x20;
  * For more fault tolerant apps, deploy across multiple zones&#x20;
  * Google Compute Engine VM are specific zone
* Regions are independent geographic areas that are made up of _zones_.
  * Disaster recovery plan necessary to recover your application if an entire primary region is lost&#x20;
  * Regional resources are deployed with redundancy within a region
* Multi-regional resources are managed by Google to be redundant and distributed across regions. Some tradeoffs may be necessary in terms of latency or consistency. Examples:
  * Google App Engine&#x20;
  * Google Cloud Datastore&#x20;
  * Google Cloud Storage&#x20;
  * Google BigQuery&#x20;

### Pricing&#x20;

* Per-second billing for IaaS compute engine, K8, and more&#x20;
* Auto-applied sustained-use discounts for certain services
* Online pricing calculator can help estimate costs&#x20;
* Open APIs and Open source services give customers ability to run applications via other CSP if Google is no longer a good fit&#x20;
