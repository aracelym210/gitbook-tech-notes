| Ease of use               | 5     | Tested against [TerraGoat](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/terragoat)  which has templates for AWS, GCP, Oracle, and Alibaba cloud and the tool gave individual, monthly project totals and a overall monthly total. |
| Documentation             | 5     | Getting started documentation was all I needed to follow.                                                                                                                                                            |

#### Other evaluation notes:

* Ensure Terraform is up to date to latest version
* Use for free, but beware of data sharing.
  * There appears to be an option for self-hosting, but I have not explored that
